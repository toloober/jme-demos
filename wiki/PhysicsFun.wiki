PhysicsFun is a little Playground to experiment and play with jME Physics.
Some things you can do in PhysicsFun are:
  * create Objects with different Basic-Shapes and Physics-Materials and see how they react with each other.
  * modify different settings like gravity, wind, autoRestThreshold  etc.
