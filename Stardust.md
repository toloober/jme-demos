# Introduction #
Stardust is still very incomplete and not very nicely structured. Its also not actively being developed.


You can check out the source via svn: http://code.google.com/p/jme-demos/source/browse/trunk/stardust

You can also try to play an older Version via Java Webstart:
http://www.stardust.ch/webstart/stardust.jnlp

You will probably need Java 6 to be able to Web-Start! (sorry Mac OS Users)
